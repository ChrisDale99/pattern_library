# Chris dale Pattern Library

A simple pattern library that shows some HTML and CSS that I have learned in my first year of IXD101.

The structure of the objects - Components - CSS 

The Objects folder contains: color.html - head.html - typography.html

The Components folder contains: nav-libnks.html

The CSS folder contains: style.css

# Objects links:
